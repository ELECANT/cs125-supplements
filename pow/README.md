# Problem of the Week

This folder is a curated collection of programming solutions from students and TAs. Even though these solutions are organized by chapters, this folder is called "Problem of the Week" because problems of a chapter are often assigned in one week, and it sounds *much* better than "Problem of the Chapter".

Authors of these solutions are either identified by author names in the source files. If an author name is not present, the author is identified by the commit.
